	<h4>Risk Management</h4>
							<p class="desktop">Every option trade requires adjustments to deliver maximum gains or protect against losses.

That’s why we monitor our trades continuously, and send you adjustment alerts the moment it becomes necessary. Each adjustment comes as a modeled strategy and ready for your stockbroker with just a click of a button.</p>
